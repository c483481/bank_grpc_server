# Bank gRPC Server

This is a practice project for creating a bank gRPC server using Go. This project uses the protocol from the module github.com/c483481/bank_grpc_proto and is a modification based on the course "Go Microservice Protocol Buffers gRPC API".

## introduction

This project aims to learn and understand how to implement a gRPC server with Protocol Buffers in Go. By using the protobuf module generated in a separate repository, we can ensure that both the server and the client use the same protobuf definitions.
